# First PHP Project

I am learning the basics of procedural PHP, and creating a customized database.

Authorized users can reserve a vehicle, and check if the vehicle is already reserved. Users who have made a reservation can also leave a review for the rented vehicle

Worked with PDO and checked for SQL injections, as well as form validation on the client and server side.

It has an admin panel with all CRUD operations for customizing the app's content.

Afterward, a chatbot was created using a web socket (Pusher). Responding to messages is enabled on the admin panel when a new user sends a new message, and a new chat is opened for replies

More information is available on the author page in the documentation.
