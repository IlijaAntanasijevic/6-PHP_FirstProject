# First PHP Project

Learning the basics of procedural PHP, creating a customized database.

Authorized users can reserve a vehicle, check if the vehicle is already reserved. Users who have made a reservation can also leave a review for the rented vehicle

Worked with PDO and checks for SQL injections, also form validation on the client and server side.

It has an admin panel with all CRUD operations for customizing the content of the app
